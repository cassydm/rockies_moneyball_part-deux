# Prophet Challenge: Analyzing Search Traffic and Stock Price Patterns

## Overview

This analysis seeks to rejuvenate the Colorado Rockies by applying a "Moneyball" strategy, which involves a rigorous statistical analysis comparing the current players' performance metrics with those of the 2007 World Series team. By meticulously evaluating player statistics and identifying critical performance indicators, we aim to pinpoint strengths and weaknesses in the current lineup. Through this process, we will recommend targeted changes such as potential trades or acquisitions to optimize team composition and improve overall performance. 

Our objective is to strategically position the Rockies for a return to the World Series, drawing on historical successes of the 2007 team and modern analytics to guide our decisions. With a focus on continuous monitoring and adaptive strategies, we envision a revitalized team that excels in the competitive landscape of Major League Baseball.


## Data Overview

Data was collected for the Rockies 2007 and 2024 rosters from Baseball Reference resource online. The team both scraped tables from the website and downloaded excel documents to perform our analysis. 

The team took a 4-pronged approach to dividing and reviewing the data. Each team member looked at a specific subset of player statistics, including batting, pitching, and fielding. Additionally our team looked at appearance and salary data to help us determine whether certain players contribute their “worth”  to the Rockies. 

Each team member performed several statistical analysis and visualizations to better understand how the 2007 and 2024 teams performed relative to each other and identify areas for the 2024 Rockies to improve. 

## Questions to Answer
